# ASHMPS Fact Sheets
The 2023 American Seafood Harvesters Marketing Practices Survey is the first-ever national assessment of the direct seafood sector. The survey aims to fill a gap in our understanding of the domestic seafood market in the US and bring greater focus to the socioeconomic contributions of seafood in the nationâ€™s local and regional food systems.
